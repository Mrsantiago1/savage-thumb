## Summary
This is a cloned repo where I was tasked with making the thumb down functionality work. I simply added another event listener and added another put request for the thumb down icon. The original code had two spans where the number of votes for up and down votes were located side by side. I optimized the code by adding a function to subtract the down votes from the up votes before printing the final total value to the DOM. This improves the interface by clarifying the total number of votes and simplifying the interface.
